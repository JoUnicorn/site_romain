  <h4> 1 -ARTWORK</h4>
  <p>
    I do not limit myself to illustrating popular icons such as Porsches or Jaguars, but rather try to select unique vehicles that are representative of an era, a race, a country or specific technological advancements. A lot of them have a very peculiar design to start with, which makes the whole illustration process very fun. Some are unique concept cars hand built by a couple car nerds in their shed, and were never mass produced. A few of them were even left abandoned or destroyed at some point. y0 is also meant to immortalize all those fallen heroes.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Living in South Korea, a country where the first car was produced in 1955 and with an almost
    nonexistent classic car/racing culture, you might guess I seldom have opportunities to walk
    around and study properly most of the models I draw.
  </p>

  <p>
    I rely mostly on the internet to search for reference pictures. I would sometimes spend hours
    looking for a proper side view, lamps, door handles or wipers spare part pictures, since some of the cars I draw are one-off concepts from 60~70 years ago with very few high resolution pictures to work from. The challenge is quite fun!
  </p>

  <p>
    I start by outlining the different shapes and details which can also take hours, depending on the
    resolution of the reference pictures. After that, I can start painting away, always in shades of grey, to make sure the basic shading emphasizes best the shape of the car.
  </p>

  <p>
    I then select the most representative body paint color for each model, and an antagonist flat
    color for the background to make it pop, without crushing it.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, I give the final touch to the artwork with a precise vector outline of the car emblem, one
    paragraph of text about the car features and brief history/fun facts. And for cars that do not
    really have an emblem? I carefully select a font that best represents the era during which it was
    built.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of my pieces are made of 500+ individual layers organized meticulously, and each
    illustration takes between 20 and 70 hours to finalize, depending on the complexity/rarity of the
    model.
  </p>
  <h4> 2 -PRINT</h4>
  <p>
    I chose to trust UH5, a professional haut-de-gamme print shop in Roubaix, France, where a polyvalent team of professionals with years of experience in printing techniques and the utmost exigence for quality and finishing will take care of your artwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    They work with museum-grade Hahnemülle fine art paper, Epson plotters equipped with archival inks to make sure the artworks come out absolutely perfect and last forever.
  </p>
  <h4> 3 -LAMINATION</h4>
  <p>
    UH5 offers several options for lamination, from which you can choose in the shop section.
    The artwork is carefully bonded by their expert on a rigid support to give the artwork its thickness and depth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lamination adds rigidity, elegance, lightness and durability to the artworks. It can then be framed or left as it is, according to one's taste.
  </p>
  <h4> 4 -FRAMING</h4>
  <p>
    The primary function of a frame is to protect and emphasize the artwork.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you feel proud of your newly acquired art piece and eventually want to show it off, a frame will
    definitely grab the attention of your family, guests or coworkers.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can choose between different profiles of metal & wooden frames, with optional glass
    windows treated against UVs and fingerprint. The team at UH5 masters perfectly every framing
    technique, from the most classical to the latest, and can accomodate any format to make sure
    your artwork is unique.
  </p>
  <h4> 5 -SHIPPING</h4>
  <p>
    Your finished piece will ship directly from UH5. They support worldwide shipping.
